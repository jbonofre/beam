# Example Pipelines- DSL Declarative API

The examples included in this module serve to demonstrate the basic
functionality of Apache Beam, and act as starting points for
the development of more complex pipelines.

## Word Count

Few examples using Apache Beam Declarative API.

1. [`WordCount`]is the simplest word count pipeline and introduces basic beam DSL https://github.com/jbonofre/beam/blob/DSL_XML/dsls/xml/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/dsls/xml/example/wordcount/BeamFlow-File-in-File-out.xml

## Running Examples

#### How to run the example with DSL
##### Run with direct runner
 mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.dsls.xml.flow.loader.BeamFlowDSLRunner -Dexec.args="--dslXml=**src/main/java/org/apache/beam/dsls/xml/example/wordcount/BeamFlow-File-in-File-out.xml**" -Pdirect-runner
##### Run with Spark runner
 mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.dsls.xml.flow.loader.BeamFlowDSLRunner -Dexec.args="--dslXml=**src/main/java/org/apache/beam/dsls/xml/example/wordcount/BeamFlow-File-in-File-out.xml** " -Pspark-runner
##### Run with Flink runner 
 mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.dsls.xml.flow.loader.BeamFlowDSLRunner -Dexec.args="--dslXml=**src/main/java/org/apache/beam/dsls/xml/example/wordcount/BeamFlow-File-in-File-out.xml** " -Pflink-runner
##### Run with Apex runner 
 mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.dsls.xml.flow.loader.BeamFlowDSLRunner -Dexec.args="--dslXml=**src/main/java/org/apache/beam/dsls/xml/example/wordcount/BeamFlow-File-in-File-out.xml** " -Papex-runner
